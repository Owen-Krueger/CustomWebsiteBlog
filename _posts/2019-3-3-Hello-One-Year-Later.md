Hello everyone!

My name is Owen Krueger and I'm a 22 year old software developer!

# One Year of Github!

Today officially marks my one year anniversary of using Github, and I'm honestly so glad that I started using this service 365 days ago! Over the last year, I have made a total of 772 contributions and have created 38 repositories for school assignments and personal projects.
