title: Hello / One-Year Anniversary
---

Hello everyone!

<img src="../images/posts/2019-3-4-Main.jpeg" width="40%">

My name is Owen Krueger! I'm a 22 year old computer enthusiast currently living in Duluth, MN. This blog will act as a way for me to rant about all sorts of topics, those that pertain to technology and some that do not!

## One Year of Github!

Today officially marks my one year anniversary of using Github, and I'm honestly so glad that I started using this service 365 days ago! Over the last year, I have made a total of 772 contributions and have created 38 repositories for school assignments and personal projects. If anyone is considering the use of Github for their projects, I highly recommend that you give it a try! It has greatly changed the way I do work, and the benefits are great!

## Education (The importance of)

I have known that I was going to be a computer programmer since I was 10 years old and I started using our old Windows XP machine. I wanted to know everything about it -- the hardware in it, the operating system, how everything interacted. I wanted to know anything and everything about these boxes. Since then, I started reading up on programming languages and jobs I could get within the technology field. I decided that getting a bachelor's degree in computer science would be the best next step after completing high school.

This may, I will be graduating with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Computer Information Systems with a software development concentration. I'm extremely glad that I had the opportunity to pursue this degree and I appreciate all the support I've had through this experience.

If you have the opportunity to continue your education after graduating high school, I highly recommend that you do it. I've learned so much more than I thought I would and I know that I have the support behind me to make it in this industry!

## Looking Forward

Recently, I accepted a software engineering position at a company in Thief River Falls, MN. Although nervous about leaving Duluth, the place I have considered home for the last four years, I am excited about the future. I've been working for years to get to this point, and I'm stoked to finally use the skills I've been developing over the last 12 years! I'm sure you'll hear a lot more about this experience after I get started!
